- [Program Generates Covid19 Statistics and Graphs for *ANY COUNTRY* the user specifies ](https://github.com/nathanbowley98/NESC3505_Portfolio1)

*disclaimer: sadly north korea and a few other countries don't seem to exist online let alone their covid19 data.*

   [Sample of covid19 statistics and figures for countries](https://imgur.com/a/WE2ZHuq) generated almost instantly in program. 
    Here is an example of the part of the [source code](codeSnipit.md) that made this possible.
